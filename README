This script is based on kjk's (Krzysztof Kowalczyk) evernote-to-file.py script.
See https://github.com/kjk/web-blog for the original script.

The script has been updated to use the latest version of Evernote (or
at least MY version), and it splits out the Evernote notes into a file
for each note, with directories created that correspond to the
notebook that the note lives in.
